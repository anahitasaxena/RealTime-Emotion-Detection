# Real-Time Emotion Detection

## Overview
This project detects human emotions in real-time using facial expressions captured through a webcam, utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on the FER2013 dataset.

## Objectives
- Develop a real-time emotion detection system.
- Use Keras, OpenCV, and other libraries.
- Train and deploy a CNN model for emotion recognition.
- Continuously display detected emotions on live video frames.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip
- Virtual environment (optional)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/realtime-emotion-detection.git
    cd realtime-emotion-detection
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Start the emotion detection application:
```bash
python main.py
```
Ensure your webcam is connected. The application will start the live video feed and display detected emotions in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras

## Model Training
1. Import the FER2013 dataset using Kaggle API.
2. Preprocess the data.
3. Build and train the CNN model.
4. Save the trained model.

## Real-Time Emotion Detection
1. Load the pre-trained model.
2. Capture video frames using OpenCV.
3. Detect faces and classify emotions.
4. Display emotion labels on the video feed.
